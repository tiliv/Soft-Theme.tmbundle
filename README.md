# Use

Some of the initial theme elements were designed to be similar to look and feel like _iA Writer_, which happens to use the proprietary font _Nitty Light_.  Even if I owned the expensive bits, I wouldn't be allowed to put them here.  Instead, I enjoy using the [Cousine](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/cousine) font, which is free, looks pretty nice, and has a respectably tight line spacing.

I still like Menlo on the average day, but Cousine looks more _iA Writer_-y, which I've grown accustomed to using over the months.
