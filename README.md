# Installation

Clone/download the repository and place/symlink it to ``~/Library/Application Support/Avian/Bundles``.

# Wat is this?

I've used dark themes most of my career (Twilight, you were my first true love).  I formed this affinity probably because every IDE I've ever touched comes with a light theme with bad contrasts.  Stark whites with unmitigated hard blue text.

Eventually I figured it had to be possible for me to make a light theme that I could dogfood and eventually enjoy using.

This is it!

I started the color scheme based on Twilight's (all but the light background, of course), and I've adjusted the colors over time as I find things needing attention.
